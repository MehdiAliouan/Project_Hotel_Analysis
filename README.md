# Project_Hotel_Analysis

Situation:

The project involves analyzing a dataset From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)
containing booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel.
The dataset includes details such as booking dates, length of stay, and the number of guests.

Task:

The tasks include building a database, developing SQL queries, connecting Power BI to the database, and creating a visual data story using Power BI.

Action:

The analysis involves answering key questions such as:
Is hotel revenue growing by year?
How many bookings were canceled?
What is the booking ratio between resort and city hotels?
What is the percentage of bookings for each year by hotel type?
Which is the busiest month for hotels?
How long do people stay in the hotels?
The project uses SQL for data querying and Power BI for data visualization.

Result:

Key insights include:
Significant revenue increase from 2018 to 2019, with a slight drop in resort hotel revenue in 2020.
29.98% of bookings were canceled.
More than 60% of bookings were for the city hotel.
Double the bookings in 2019 compared to the previous year, but a 15% decrease the next year.
The busiest months are July and August.
Most people stay 1-4 nights in city hotels and more than 5 nights in resort hotels.
A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize these insights.
